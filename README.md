# animated-svgs

Made this cool looking animated svg for a website i was working on. Got stuck for almost an hour becoz i cud not add it as the background. Turns out you cannot directly add an SVG as the background when you are using TailwindCSS. Still could not let this cool SVG to go to waste. Hehe.
